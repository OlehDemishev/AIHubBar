# Decisions

Decisions made where the spec is silent or does not match reality. Newest at the top.

## 2026-10-29 — Stage 1 (skeleton)

**Environment differs from the spec.** The spec says macOS 26; the machine runs macOS 27.2 with Xcode 27.1 (Swift 6.4, macOS 27.0 SDK). Nothing in stage 1 depends on this. The deployment target stays macOS 14 as specified.

**XcodeGen.** Was not installed; installed with `brew install xcodegen` (2.46.0). It works with Xcode 27.1, so the spec's approach is kept: `project.yml` is the source of truth, `ClaudeBar.xcodeproj` and `ClaudeBar/Info.plist` are generated and git-ignored.

**Signing.** The keychain has no code signing identities, so the app is signed ad-hoc (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = "-"`, manual style, no team). `SMAppService.mainApp` registration works with an ad-hoc signature (checked). Hardened Runtime is off for now; App Sandbox is off as required by the spec. If Apple Events to Terminal (stage 3) need it, revisit together with the `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` entitlement.

**Swift language mode.** `SWIFT_VERSION = 6.0` (Swift 6 language mode, complete concurrency checking) — the Swift 6.4 compiler builds it in that mode.

**Bundle identifier** `com.demishev.claudebar`, in line with the existing `com.demishev.projects-*` launchd agents.

**Menu bar icon.** SF Symbol `sparkle` (✦, a nod to Claude). The coloured health dot and the waiting-sessions badge from spec 2.1 come in stages 2 and 4.

**Login item states.** `SMAppService.mainApp.status` returns `.notFound` until the app has been registered once, not `.notRegistered`. Both are shown as "off". `.requiresApproval` is shown as "on" with a hint and a button that opens System Settings → Login Items.

**Command-line mode** (`ClaudeBar --login-item status|on|off`). Added so the login item can be checked from a script: on macOS 27 menu bar items are drawn by the system `MenuBarAgent`, and the app (an `LSUIElement` agent) cannot be granted to computer-use tools, so its panel and Settings window cannot be driven from automation. The command goes through the same `LoginItemController` as the Settings toggle.

**Tests** use Swift Testing (`import Testing`) in a hosted unit-test bundle.

**Build script** builds with `-destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64'` (Apple Silicon only, avoids the "multiple matching destinations" warning) into `build/DerivedData` inside the project, so builds are reproducible and covered by the auto-cleanup of `build/`.
